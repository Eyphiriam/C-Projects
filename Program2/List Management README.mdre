# README for List Management System

This README document provides a comprehensive overview of the List Management System, a simple C++ program that implements a singly linked list. The system allows users to perform basic operations such as insertion, deletion, display, and search on a list of integers.

## Project Overview

The List Management System is designed to demonstrate the fundamental operations on a singly linked list in C++. It provides an interactive menu-driven interface for users to manipulate the list by adding elements, removing elements, displaying the list, and searching for elements within the list. The project is structured into three main files:

- **`List.h`**: This header file defines the `List` class and the `node` structure. It declares all the member functions and variables used in the list operations.
- **`List.cpp`**: This source file implements the functions declared in `List.h`. It includes the logic for operations such as insertion, deletion, display, and search within the list.
- **`Main.cpp`**: This file contains the `main` function and provides a user interface for interacting with the list. It handles menu selection and user input.

## Features

- **Insertion**: Add elements to the end of the list.
- **Deletion**: Remove specified elements from the list.
- **Display**: Show all elements in the list in the order they were inserted.
- **Search**: Find and return the position of a specific element in the list.
- **Interactive Menu**: Navigate through operations using a simple menu.

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the list. The menu provides options to insert, delete, display, and search for elements in the list.
