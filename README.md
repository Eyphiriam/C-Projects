# Comprehensive README for C Programming Projects

This README document provides a detailed overview of several C programming projects, including a custom Unix shell (Aggie Shell), a Binary Search Tree for dish counting, and a List Management System. Each project demonstrates different aspects of C programming, from basic data structure manipulation to system-level programming. Additionally, each project is accompanied by either a README or a PDF file that outlines what the code should be capable of, ensuring that users and developers can understand the functionality and scope of each project.

## Aggie Shell

### Overview

Aggie Shell is a simple Unix shell implemented in C that allows users to execute commands, manage files, and interact with the operating system. It supports basic shell functionalities such as changing directories, setting environment variables, and executing system commands.

### Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute any command available in the system's PATH.
- **Built-in Commands**: Includes `cd` for changing directories and `path` for setting the PATH environment variable.
- **Environment Variable Management**: Users can view and set environment variables.
- **Batch Processing**: Execute commands from a batch file.

### Usage

Run the shell and type commands directly into the prompt. Use `cd` to change directories, `path` to set the PATH, and `exit` to quit the shell.

## Binary Search Tree for Dish Counting

### Overview

This project uses a binary search tree to count how many times each dish is ordered based on user input. It maps dish numbers to dish names and displays the count for each dish.

### Features

- **Binary Search Tree**: Efficiently counts and organizes dishes.
- **Dish Mapping**: Maps numbers to dish names for easy identification.
- **User Input Handling**: Processes a string of dish numbers entered by the user.

### Usage

Input dish numbers separated by spaces. The program will display each dish with its corresponding count.

## List Management System

### Overview

The List Management System is a simple implementation of a singly linked list in C++. It allows users to add elements, remove elements, and search for elements within the list.

### Features

- **Insertion and Deletion**: Users can add and remove elements from the list.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for the position of an element in the list.
- **Display**: Show all elements in the list.

### Usage

Use the interactive menu to choose between inserting, deleting, displaying, or searching for elements in the list.

## Documentation and Guides

Each project is documented thoroughly to ensure that users and developers can easily understand and interact with the system. The documentation includes:

- **README Files**: Provide a quick overview of each project's capabilities, setup instructions, and usage examples.
- **PDF Guides**: Offer detailed explanations of the project's functionality, including diagrams and code snippets where applicable.
